Slowly growing collection of scripts related to canvas external tools, analytics, etc.

### exass.js
Export Assignments - creates a file with archive-able information from an assignment/classic canvas quiz.
Generates an archive-spec XML file.

### teacherMatch.js
Takes a list of users from Mentimeter, and matches it with teachers and students.
